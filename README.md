Bento is a Matlab GUI for browsing and annotating joint calcium imaging + video datasets.

## Getting Started

Want to get a quick visual sense of what's going on in your data? Bento lets you browse and annotate behavioral and neural data, and makes it easy to organize and navigate trials within a batch of experiments.

### Prerequisites
* Matlab 2014b or later
* Microsoft Excel (for assembling of metadata. This requirement will be softened in the future.)

### Additional Resources
* [Piotr's Matlab Toolbox](https://pdollar.github.io/toolbox/) if behavior videos are in *.seq format
* [Source2D Toolbox](https://github.com/zhoupc/CNMF_E) (in ca_source_extraction) if using calcium traces extracted with CNMF_E

## Installation
The easiest way to keep your local version up to date is to clone this git repository; GitHub's software then lets you update to the latest version of the code at the press of a button.

A copy of the code is also posted to the Anderson lab private server, however this copy is less frequently updated.

## Creating your first experiment
